        | This year, JSDC is breaking the barriers by integrating the technical power from independent 
        | developers, enterprises, framewords, architectures, and practices. We aim to make the knowledge 
        | globally interchangeable, while makeing all attendees reimagine JavaScript within and beyond 
        | the dogma. Our new thinking will be a catalyst for further improvement of the architectures. 
        | fortification of the teams, and optimization of the development process.
